<!---Creating Service Accounts--->
<h2><b>ü™™ Making Service Accounts</b></h2>
<p><b>Service Accounts are just like normal Google Account and thus have same Upload or Download limits as Google Account which is 750 GB Upload and 10 TB Download. They are used to act on behalf of a Google Account and hence we can use them to prevent hitting Google Drive limits by creating them in a bulk amount. After creating Service Accounts, we have to add them in Google Group so that we can directly add Google Group's Email ID in Shared Drive at place of adding each Service Accounts manually.</b></p>
